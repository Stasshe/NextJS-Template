instructions
Be sure to reread the file and check for errors whenever you make a large change of 5 lines or more.

Always read the correct position and make modifications at the correct place. Pay attention to JSX syntax.

When fixing errors, check for errors before making corrections.

Use the correct editing tools. Use new ones if possible.

When I give instructions, I always test everything first, so never prompt to start the development server at the beginning.

Every time you edit, check if the file already exists. If not, create it for the first time. Use the replacement tool correctly. Always refer to README.md.

You can use icon libraries, for example, lucide, react-icons, etc.
If any icon library is not included, install it.
