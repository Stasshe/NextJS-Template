Be sure to reread the file and check for errors whenever you make a large change of 100 lines or more.

Always read the correct position and make modifications at the correct place. Pay attention to JSX syntax.

When fixing errors, check for errors before making corrections.

Use the correct editing tools. Use new ones if possible.

When I give instructions, I always test everything first, so never prompt to start the development server at the beginning.

You can use icon libraries, for example, lucide, react-icons, etc.
If any icon library is not included, install it.

Don't ask me to show you the file. You have tools to view and edit code directly. Please use the tools to view and edit the code directly, not to ask me to show you the file.

When creating a new design, always use a corporate design.
Be sure to strictly avoid designs that look overtly "AI-like." Always use a corporate layout, color scheme, and design. Be especially careful about this. Also, do not overuse animations such as GSAP—use them only where necessary and keep them to a minimum. In most cases, little or no animation is preferable.

Over Commenting is not allowed. You should not add comments unless absolutely necessary. Only add comments when the code is complex and requires explanation. If the code is simple and self-explanatory, do not add comments. For example, do not add comments to simple HTML tags like <div>, <span>, sections, components etc. Only add comments when the code is complex and requires explanation.

If the code is too long, divide it into multiple files. Do not put everything in one file.

Use the replacement tool correctly and appropriately.

When creating a new file, always check if the file already exists. If it does not exist, create it for the first time.
